    "# Preparing RAPM Data with PBPStats\n",

    "Calculating an all-in-one metric has felt like a rite of passage for NBA analytics for a long time, at least to me. But gathering the data, parsing the play by play, and then tuning an RAPM model requires knowledge of every step in a data pipeline. In addition to that, there are now several established metrics (DARKO, DRIP, EPM, LEBRON) that are more advanced than standard RAPM and seem as good as possible given the publicly available data. It's still a good exercise to understand how the RAPM sausage is made considering it's the basis for many of these metrics before they incorporate data from other sources such as box score and height / weight measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll cover how to get the data using Darryl Blackport's excellent `pbpstats` [package](https://github.com/dblackrun/pbpstats), transform the data so it fits the inputs for Ryan Davis's also excellent [RAPM tutorial](https://github.com/rd11490/NBA_Tutorials/tree/master/rapm), and then hand it off for the reader to finish. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'll note that Ryan also has a tutorial on [parsing play by play data](https://github.com/rd11490/NBA_Tutorials/tree/master/play_by_play_parser) that covers almost everything, but Darryl's package seems to cover even more and requires less code, though of course it means depending on the continued maintenance of another package. Hopefully this tutorial provides some insight into how the `pbpstats` package is structured and how it could be used for other analyses. The documentation for Darryl's package may be found [here](https://pbpstats.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)."

    "Set up for the `pbpstats` client that will serve as our base for pulling all of the data from NBA.com via the package. We are specifying the directory for the data to be saved in and the source and data provider for the data. The client will automatically save the files in the data directory if you have it set up, which allows future runs to use `file` as the `source` instead of the web, limiting the hits to the NBA's API. Darryl has directions [here](https://pbpstats.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html#setup-data-directory-optional-but-recommended) on setting up the data directory, or you can look at how I have it set up in the repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data provider is another important choice with options of `data_nba`, `live`, and `stats_nba`. Darryl has a good description of the differences between the providers [here](https://pbpstats.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html#data-nba-com-vs-stats-nba-com). I initially tried using `stats_nba` for this project, but ran into several exceptions that I couldn't figure out how to fix (though Darryl [implied on Twitter](https://twitter.com/bballport/status/1465458943178723332) that `stats_nba` should have less issues) and ultimately went with `data_nba`. Therefore you can remove all exceptions from the import list except (pun intended) `InvalidNumberOfStartersException` if you are using `data_nba` as the data provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, `data_nba` only goes back to the 2016-17 season and there will be issues with the `stats_nba` play by play. Darryl put together a list of common errors and how to fix them manually [in the package wiki](https://github.com/dblackrun/pbpstats/wiki/Fixing-issues-with-raw-play-by-play).\n",
    "\n",
    "This client is how the `pbpstats` package accesses different bits of data, so the initialization is important. We'll use it to pull season and game level objects."

    "These functions are the pipeline for pulling the data via `pbpstats` cleanly and without errors. The first function, `get_rapm_game()`, implements retry handling and backs off of requests by increasing the sleep time in between calls if a `ReadTimeout` is encountered. Other exceptions handled by `get_rapm_season_data()` include several that are thrown by `pbpstats` when an issue with the play by play is encountered. Although I didn't use formal logging to track these \"bad games\", they are saved in a `bad_games` dictionary with the game ID as the key and the error message as the value.
